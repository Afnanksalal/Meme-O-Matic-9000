# Meme-o-Matic 9000: Quantum Chaos Edition ☢️

## Basic Details

### Creator: Afnan K Salal

### Project Description

The Meme-o-Matic 9000 is a Chrome extension that turns my web browser into a chaotic, brain-rot-fueled journey through the digital absurd. It's a game, a meme viewer, and an existential crisis generator all in one.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In a world of predictable memes and stable Browse, humanity is losing its ability to question reality. I faced a profound lack of digital chaos, and the collective sanity of the internet was dangerously high. Something had to be done.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

I built a Chrome extension to systematically dismantle my sanity, one meme at a time. The Meme-o-Matic 9000 dynamically pulls content from the deepest corners of the web, escalating its chaotic effects based on my mental state. The lower my sanity, the more surreal and unsettling the memes become, guaranteeing a descent into delicious digital madness.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:

  - **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - **Libraries:** Chrome Extension API (`chrome.storage`, `chrome.tabs`)
  - **APIs:**
      - `meme-api.com`: For a stream of fresh Reddit memes.
      - `api.memegen.link`: For classic image macro templates.
      - `dog.ceo/api`: For wholesome dog memes (sanity boost\!).
      - `api.thecatapi.com`: For feline overlord content.
      - `soundhelix.com`: For a stream of chaotic background music.

### Implementation

My project is a client-side Chrome extension with all logic contained within `popup.js` and `manifest.json`. No server-side components are required.

# Installation

1.  Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4.  Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder.

# Run

The extension will appear in your Chrome toolbar. Click the icon to open the **Meme-o-Matic 9000**. Hit "INITIATE MEME SEQUENCE" to begin your descent into chaos.

## Game Mechanics

The Meme-o-Matic 9000 is more than just a viewer—it's a game with persistent stats:

  * **Chaos Meter**: Fills up with every meme you see. The higher the chaos, the faster your sanity drains.
  * **Sanity Left**: My most important stat. Click "Good Meme" to regain some sanity and reduce the chaos. Click "Bad Meme" to suffer the consequences.
  * **Chaos Controls**: Trigger **Chaos Mode** to open a few meme tabs, or escalate to **Mega Chaos** and **Apocalypse** for a brain-melting flood of content.
  * **Reality Distortion**: Apply visual filters like **GLITCH**, **PSYCHO**, and **INVERT** to further destabilize your reality.
  * **Audio Abominations**: A random sound from my pre-loaded soundboard will play when you open the extension. You can hit the mute button to silence the madness, but for how long?
